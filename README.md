```

or

```shell
$ poetry add mtg-parser
```


## Supported Formats

> [!NOTE]
> `mtg_parser` has been developed with a primary *focus on Commander*.
> While it may function with other formats, compatibility is not guaranteed.


In addition to [MTGO](mtgo.com) and [MTGA](magic.wizards.com/mtgarena) formats, `mtg_parser` supports the following websites:
- [aetherhub.com](aetherhub.com)
- [archidekt.com](archidekt.com)
- [deckstats.net](deckstats.net)
- [moxfield.com](moxfield.com)
- [mtggoldfish.com](mtggoldfish.com)
- [mtgjson.com](mtgjson.com)

- [tappedout.net](tappedout.net)
- [infinite.tcgplayer.com](infinite.tcgplayer.com)
- [decks.tcgplayer.com](decks.tcgplayer.com)


## Known issues

Parsing decklists on some websites require a bit more work:

- Moxfield.com requires a custom User-Agent ([see here](#parsing-from-moxfieldcom))


## Usage


### QuickStart

Start by importing the `mtg_parser` module:

```python
import mtg_parser
```

Now let's parse a decklist (in any of the supported formats) and display the cards:

```python
cards = mtg_parser.parse_deck(url)
for card in cards:
    print(card)
```

`parse_deck()` methods return a generator of `Card` objects matching the following description

```python
class Card:
    name: str
    quantity: int = 1
    extension: Optional[str] = None
    number: Optional[str] = None
    tags: List[str] = []
```


### Advanced - Parsing

`mtg_parser.parse_deck()` is a shortcut method to the specialized versions.
If `url` is a valid Moxfield url, the following lines are equivalent:

```python
cards = mtg_parser.parse_deck(url)
# is the same as:
cards = mtg_parser.moxfield.parse_deck(url)
```

In general, it's advised to use `mtg_parser.parse_deck()` as the overhead is insignificant.


### Advanced - Configuration

> [!NOTE]
> As of `mtg_parser="=>0.0.1a40"` switched to [httpx](https://pypi.org/project/httpx)
> instead of [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests).

If for any reason, you need to configure how `mtg_parser` fetches remote decklists, you can provide an optional `httpx.Client` object.

```python
import httpx

headers = {'user-agent': 'my-custom-user-agent/0.0.1'}
with httpx.Client(headers=headers) as client:
    cards = mtg_parser.parse_deck(url, http_client=client)
    for card in cards:
        print(card)
```

If no `httpx.Client` object is provided, one will be created for you.


### Parsing MTGO / MTGA

`mtg_parser` can parse textual decklists in either MTGO or MTGA format

```python
import mtg_parser

decklist = """
    1 Atraxa, Praetors' Voice
    1 Imperial Seal
    1 Lim-DÃ»l's Vault
    1 Jeweled Lotus (CMR) 319
    1 Llanowar Elves (M12) 182
    3 Brainstorm #Card Advantage #Draw
"""

cards = mtg_parser.parse_deck(deck_list)
# or the less recommended form:
# cards = mtg_parser.decklist.parse_deck(deck_list)
for card in cards:
    print(card)
```
